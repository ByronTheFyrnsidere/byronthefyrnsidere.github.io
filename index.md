# *Wes hƒÅl* and welcome to my personal website

I am a Fyrnsidere (a practitioner of Fyrnsidu, 
see below) from the Midwestern USA. I am very
passionate about the [Anglo-Saxon Calendar](https://minewyrtruman.wordpress.com/the-anglo-saxon-calendar/),
the [Futhorc runes](https://minewyrtruman.wordpress.com/2020/06/10/writing-in-anglo-saxon-runes/),
science fiction, role-playing games (both computer
and tabletop role-playing games), and liberal
politics.

I am a bisexual man in a monogamous relationship,
happily engaged to a wonderful woman, and have 
two very intelligent children whom I very proud of.

## What is Fyrnsidu

Fyrnsidu is a revival of the pre-Christian religion
of the Anglo-Saxons, the Germanic tribes that migrated
from the area of modern day Germany at the start
of the fifth century. It is a polytheistic faith,
with elements of animism and ancestor veneration.
The best resource for learning about Fyrnsidu is
