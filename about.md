## About the blog

*Mīne Wyrtruman* means *My Roots* in Old English. As a Fyrnsidere (Anglo-Saxon Heathen), the culture and religion of the ancient pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon peoples are the roots of my faith. I use the little that we know about them as a foundation upon which I build my religion.

Mine Wyrtruman is inclusive, believing that all who feel called are welcome to heathenry, regardless of race or ethnicity. I condemn all types of racism, including ‘folkish’ heathenry.

As the ancient Anglo-Saxon heathens were polytheistic, so is Mine Wyrtruman. I reject the monotheism of Judeo-Christian religions and the duotheism of traditional Wicca. I do not, however, have a problem with Christians or Wiccans.

I plan to cover a wide range of heathen related subjects on this blog, from heathen basics (frith, inner and outer yard, wyrd, orlæg, etc.), runes, racism within heathenry, among many other things.

## About the author

I am an Anglo-Saxon Heathen man in my early thirties living in the Midwestern United States. My interests include studying comparative religion, history, and computer programming. I love science fiction, and playing video games. I’m currently studying the Futhorc (Anglo-Saxon) runes, both from an academic perspective as well as a more magical perspective.
