# Young Penda and the Swamp Ettin
## By ByronTheFyrnsidere

# Act I

The mead hall of Coenwalh was loud, way too loud. Penda adored his older brother, but he did not enjoy the rambunctious parties his brother held every night.

"Have another ale, my friend, and rid your face of that grimace," said a thick Welsh accent.

Penda smiled weakly at his friend Cadwallon. "A party on occasion is wonderful, but you're not here every night to endure the endless drama."

Cadwallon took a deep swig of his ale. "If your ealdormen had chosen your brother to be king instead of your uncle Cearl, he wouldn't have time for endless partying."

"Do not mention that puppet in my presence!" snarled Coenwalh, clearly having had too much to drink, "If I were the king, we wouldn't be servants to the Northumbrians! The wealth of Mercia would remain in Mercia, instead of being sent as tribute to that traitor's father in law Edwin."

Penda rolled his eyes, as their brother Eowa spoke up. "Come now, brother, you must be more careful what you say. Our dearest uncle has his spies everywhere. If he were to catch word of you speaking like that, I would be inheriting this fine mead hall from you."

"If it wasn't for Cearl, Edwin king of Northumbria would have conquered Mercia and all the sons of Pybba would have been executed years ago!"

Every head in the mead hall turned towards Oswald, glaring. "We are descendants of Icel the Great!" Penda exclaimed, "W≈çden would have given us the victory over those Christians! Northumbria would be bowing the knee to us!"

"Get out!" Coenwalh said sternly to Oswald, "If I ever see you again, I will tear you apart limb by limb with my bare hands."

Eowa spoke up, "Now brother, there is no need to-"

"*I said get out of here!*" Coenwalh roared, jumping to his feet and grabbing his father Pybba's sword from above the hearth.

By the time Coenwalh had turned back around to face Oswald, Cearl's defender was gone. "There goes our only chance of Cearl not hearing about this," Penda sighed.

"You're not happy here," Cadwallon said to Penda, "Come back with me and spend some time among your mother's people."

It was the next morning, and Penda's Welsh friend was preparing to depart for home.

"Any other time, I may have taken you up on that," Penda replied, "But after last night's events, I need to head back to the royal court and try to smooth things over with my uncle."

"Why grovel to that spineless coward?" Cadwallon snickered, "If he dared to move against the sons of Pybba, the people of Mercia would rise up against him. And the kingdom of Gwynedd would not stand for such an offense against the sons of their most favoured daughter!"

"I know the sons of my father shall regain the throne of Mercia, but I'm not sure that provoking a war is the way to do it. The Ealdormen who placed Cearl upon the throne are not happy with his grovelling to Edwin. They're sure to choose one of Pybba's sons as the next king! We just have to survive my eldest brother's foolishness until then."

Cadwallon sighed. "I just have this feeling that bad things will befall you if you stay in Mercia."

"I have a feeling you're right, my friend, but duty to one's family must always come first, even before one's own well-being. This is the way of my people."

"Just be careful, Penda. Seventeen winters is far too young to be on your king's bad side."

Penda smiled at him, "My gods go with me, just as surely as your god goes with you."

After Cadwallon departed back for his home, Penda entered to find his brothers fighting.

"We owe that traitor nothing!" Coenwalh declared.

"Be that as it may," Eowa replied, "We *do* owe our father a legacy. Which we cannot provide if we provoke our uncle into extinguishing Pybba's line!"

"Do not worry about Cearl," Penda said, "I shall be leaving by noon to head to his court and smooth this incident over."

Coenwalh snorted. "I say-"

"You have clearly said enough already!" Penda retorted, before turning to head to his room to begin gathering his stuff.

* * *

"Are you sure this is a good idea?" 

Penda sighed. "Eowa, you know this isn't the first time Coenwalh has spoken evil of Cearl. Cearl is usually pretty angry about it, but all it takes is reminding him about his love for his brother. This time will be no different."

"This time may be different. Our eldest brother did more than just speak evil of the king. He was ready to kill a man for defending the king. Threatened to tear him limb from limb."

"I know. Which is why it's all the more important that we calm our uncle, before he sends an army after us and burns our mead hall to the ground."

"Let me go with you," Eowa pleaded.

"And leave our brother unsupervised and to his own devices? He's liable to be fermenting a rebellion before we return!"

Eowa burst into laughter. "Yeah, I can see that happening. Better I stay to keep him under control."

The brothers embraced one another. "Take care, young Penda. May the gods go with you."

"They always do, my brother. They always do."

The sun was setting when Penda came to a swamp. He briefly considered making camp outside the swamp and staying there until morning. Although he had gone through this swamp many times, it had never been at night.

"No," Penda said to himself, "I must hurry on to the king's palace, and the sooner that I get there the better."

As soon as the sun was gone, the swamp was filled with an unnatural silence. Penda could only hear the splashing of his own footsteps. Then something hit him from behind, sending him flying several feet.

Penda rose to his feet cautiously, looking around to see what had hit him. He saw a beast in the form of a human, but twice as big, with skin that looked like stone covered with splotches of moss.

"Who are you, that you dare invade *my* home?" the creature asked.

"I am Penda, the son of Pybba, and the trespassing was not intentional. I'm just trying to make my way to my uncle's place."

"Pybba... Pybba.... Why does that name sound familiar?" the monster asked.

"He was the previous king of Mercia," Penda answered.

"Oh, yes! The Anglian king who fell in love with a Welsh princess, thereby making his subjects unable to trust his half breed sons with the throne!"

Penda drew his seax from his cloak, and pointed it at the monster.

The monster began to laugh. "I am an ettin, one of the first sons of Gimm! No human sword can pierce my skin!"

Penda just smiled. "This seax is no human sword; it was forged by Wayland the Smith for my ancestor Icel!"

Penda lunged at the ettin and brought his sword to land hard on the ettin's skin. This made the ettin bellow out in pain. He smacked Penda with his huge hand, again sending Penda flying several feet.

"*I should kill you for that!*" shouted the ettin, "But I think that would be too merciful on you. Instead, death shall follow you for the rest of your life! No one around you shall be safe."

And then the ettin disappeared, leaving Penda alone.

# Act II

On the opposite side of the swamp was a small town. Like the swamp, Penda had been through this town many times. But always during the day.

It was a couple hours after sunset when Penda made it to the town. Like the swamp, it was unnaturally quiet. Penda went up to the building that he knew was the mead hall and the residence of the local thegn, and he knocked on the door.

Whenever Penda had passed through this town before, he had always thought it strange that the thegn always seemed to be hosting a party in the afternoon. Now, Penda thought it was even more strange that this soon after sunset, it was like a ghost town.

Penda again knocked on the door, and it slowly crept open and stopped at the point where someone could peek out.

Then the door opened up all the way, and Penda was pulled inside before the door was quickly shut again.

"What is going on?" Penda asked.

"Please, be quiet, lord Penda!" whispered the thegn urgently, "We do not want the ettin from the swamp to hear us!"

"What is going on?" Penda again tried asking, this time in a whisper.

"Please, just lay down and sleep. We can talk in the morning!"

Penda found an empty cot and laid down, but sleep would not come. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he saw cots all over the floor of the mead hall, each with a person. It looked like the entire town was inside the mead hall laying on the floor.

At some point he must have fallen asleep, because he woke up to screaming. There was a trail of bloody corpses leading outside.

Penda jumped to his feet, grabbed Icel's seax and ran outside. In the distance, he saw the ettin. He was smiling at Penda, blood dripping from his mouth and claws. With his seax drawn, Penda charged the ettin.

The ettin was gone by the time Penda reached where the ettin had been.

"It had many years since the last ettin attack," the voice of the thegn came from behind him, "Ever since we began doing this every night."

Penda turned around to face the thegn. "I'm so sorry."

The thegn smiled weakly, "At least it wasn't as bad as the last time. Only half a dozen people were killed, and there was no great fire this time."

"I swear to you, I shall kill this ettin and get revenge for the lives lost this night. What can you tell me about this ettin?"

"Only that he's been in that swamp since before your father gave me this town. The people here told me about him when I arrived, that he attacked every full moon. We tried many things to stop his attacks, but nothing worked until we started huddling together in the mead hall every night."

"Then that's where I shall go!" Penda declared.
