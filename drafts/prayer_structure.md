*Prayer structure*. What is it? As the name implies, it is the structure of prayer. We do not have any surviving prayers from the pre-Christian Anglo-Saxons, so we can't be certain how they structured their prayers. However, we can make a pretty good guess based upon how other Proto-Indo-Europeans did it. As [Larhus Fyrnsida](https://larhusfyrnsida.com) notes:

> This tripartite division of prayer composition is inherent within Indo-European cultural prayers. Studies of Homeric hymns, Skaldic texts, local magcial and medicinal charms, and other similar writings. This indicates an important tradition of commonality in such things as meter and format, irrespective of the “level” of divinity being approached.[^1]

The author of that article[^2] has come up with a [tripartite prayer format](https://larhusfyrnsida.com/prayer-format/) for use by Heathens, based upon the works of C. Austfeld and H. S. Versnel. (The former studied ancient Greek religion, whereas the latter studied ancient Roman religion[^3].) This prayer format has spread beyond Fyrnsidu and into the wider Heathen community. It seems to be the default prayer format among the Heathens I've encountered online[^4].

The three parts of this prayer structure is the Calling, the Reason, and the Offering.

1. **Calling**- As the name suggests, this is where you call upon the god you are praying too. Since the number three seems to have been significant in Proto-Indo-European spirituality, I like to do this in three parts: `Hail [name], [kenning/epithet], who [action]!`
    
    For example:
    
    > Hail Hreðe, the victorious goddess, who defeated Winter to make way for the return of Summer!
    
    The Calling is important because, as a polytheistic religion, there are plenty of gods in Fyrnsidu. We specify which deity we are addressing in this section. In the Latin, this was called the *invocatio*, so you may see it sometimes called the invocation.
2. **Purpose**- In the Latin, this is called the the *pars epica*. It is generally represented in academia as *the argument*. While *Larhus Fyrnsida* calls it **the Petition**, this does not fit my practice very well as most of my prayers are prayers of thanksgiving as opposed to petitions. This is the *why* of the prayer. Why are you addressing this deity, both the reason why you are praying (for example, to thank the deity for something) and three reason why this deity specifically. This is also a good place to put the reasons why this deity should listen to your prayer. To continue the example prayer we started in the last section, let's consider a purpose for our prayer to Hreðe:
    > With your help, I have overcome many obstacles, and been given many victories. I come before you today in thanksgiving, asking for nothing except that you accept my gratitude.
3. **Offering**: This is the climax of the prayer, the action or task that was the whole reason for the prayer. Since reciprocity is fundamental to Heathenry, this is usually an offering. Let's conclude the prayer we have been working on:
    > I offer you this bread to say thanks for all the victories that you have given me.  May it be well received. *[place the bread in the offering bowl]* A gift for a gift!

You may be wondering, *What's the importance of this prayer structure when we have no evidence the Anglo-Saxons made use of it?* I see it more as useful than important. If you are one to whom prayers come naturally, then feel free to use those prayers. However, many Heathens have no idea how to compose a prayer when they first become Heathens. The tripartite prayer format gives these people a starting point for writing their own prayers instead of having to rely upon the pre-written prayers of others.

[^3]: Given that the tripartite prayer format originated in studies of the Greek and Roman pre-Christian religions, it should come as no surprise that tripartite prayer format is also used in Hellenism.
